# Level 3

To increase the attractiveness of our service, we want to add the ability to subsidize some trips.

This means that we need to able to setup a trip were the passenger would pay less than what the driver will receive. In that case, our company will pay the difference as a subsidy.

In the other scenario, when the driver receive less than what the passengers pay, our company will get the commission.
